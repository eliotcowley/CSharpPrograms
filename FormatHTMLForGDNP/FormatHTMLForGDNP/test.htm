    <p>The process of getting an Xbox game (or a product that otherwise uses Xbox Live) age-rated is very similar to that for any other type of product, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind. This topic will discuss those considerations—for information on the general age ratings process, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/age-ratings">Age ratings</a>.</p>

    <p>You can access the <strong>Age ratings</strong> page for a submission from the submission overview page.</p>

    <h2 id="enter-age-ratings-manually">Enter age ratings manually</h2>

    <p>One option you will get if you have the right permissions is to manually enter ratings information for the product. You <em>must</em> select this option if you will distribute the product over physical media. Even if you won’t be distributing the product over physical media for some platforms, you still must enter age ratings manually. (If you will only be distributing the product over physical media for non-Microsoft platforms, you don’t have to manually enter age ratings and we recommend that you complete the International Age Rating Coalition questionnaire.)</p>

    <p>If you select this option, the <strong>Store age rating</strong> section will appear, where you can select the rating that best matches the content in your product.</p>

    <p><img src="/resources/images/en-us/store-age-rating.png" alt="Store age rating" /></p>

    <p>You can select <strong>Show details</strong> next to any of the options to get a description for each rating, which you can use to help you decide which rating to give your product.</p>

    <p>There is also the <strong>Other age ratings</strong> section, where you can select separate ratings for other ratings boards.</p>

    <p><img src="/resources/images/en-us/other-age-ratings.png" alt="Other age ratings" /></p>

    <p>Though these ratings are optional, if you don’t rate your product through these boards, you won’t be able to offer your product in markets that require your product to be rated by them. These markets include Russia, Taiwan, Brazil, and South Korea.</p>

    <p>When you have finished making your selections, click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page. Based on your selections, Microsoft will apply ratings to your product and show you them.</p>

    <p><img src="/resources/images/en-us/age-ratings-continue.png" alt="Age ratings" /></p>

    <p>Select <strong>Edit</strong> to revise your ratings selections, or select <strong>Continue</strong> if you’re happy with your ratings.</p>

    <h2 id="age-ratings-for-different-platforms">Age ratings for different platforms</h2>

    <p>You don’t need to request separate age ratings for a product if it will be offered on multiple platforms. For example, if your game is the same experience on Xbox as it is on PC, you should use the same ratings and certificate for both. (If your product is a UWP targeting multiple platforms, this won’t be an issue as it’s a single product in the Dev Center.)</p>
